Notes on exploring data from the MBTA server:

1 b) using the filter attribute in the request reduces the volume of data returned:
     - imposes less load on the MBTA server
     - more efficient than returning everything, then filtering/discarding on the client side
     - faster response (mimimal data is better suited for low bandwidth channels)
