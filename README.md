# mbta-demo

This project contains examples of how to use data published on the MBTA server.
The programs were developed using dart (version 2.14) on Linux.
(Dart is available for multiple platforms including MacOS, Windows and Linux).

If you're using a Linux environment, you can use the run-all.sh script to run these programs
and display the results by opening a terminal window and typing "./run-all.sh" to the shell.

Here is a manifest of the deliverables:
* README.md - this summary
* design-notes.txt - analysis of the programming goals and the approach taken
* run-all.sh - wrapper ahell script to invoke the programs
* fetch-subway.dart - simple query to the MBTA server to obtain subway lines
